The presented research endeavours to address one of the most critical challenges in the process of automatic detection and anonymization of PII 
within the unstructured text of school students' writings.
Methods of machine learning, in particular, named entity recognition and transformer-based models involving BERT, introduce in this context contextual 
awareness required for the identification of less structured PII.
The following study proposes a hybrid approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency by incorporating rule-based methods into the ML model. 
A scalable solution was developed that includes data pre-processing, training an NER model, and deploying a web-based redaction tool. 
These results emphasize the reduced manual effort, better privacy compliance, and possible applications across education, healthcare, and other domains 
that require privacy sensitivity.
